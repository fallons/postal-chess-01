# This is the working version of the chess application.
# I thinks it is time to call this the final version - it is still a 
# bit clunky for the user to login and choos a colour 
# but making that better will need so fundemental restructuring
# which is probably not a good use of time.

# This was all was foremost a way to learn this platform and it has 
# been a great learing experience
